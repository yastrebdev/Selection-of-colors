## Implemented functionality

1. Randomly generate colors and display them in the interface with the "space" key
2. Defining a color shade to display text elements correctly using the croma.js library
3. After pressing the lock the selected color is locked and the next time you press the space bar does not change
4. The generated colours go to the url bar of the browser, so that the final palette can be transferred to another user
5. The color code is copied by clicking on it

## How does it work?

1. Go to https://yastrebdev.github.io/Selection-of-colors/ and press the space bar to start
2. You can also download the repository, open it in any convenient development environment and run it on the local server
